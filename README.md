# mythtv-skyuk

This is for my own personal use, however others may find handy.

DISCLAIMER - I am by no means a programmer, or expert, this is all info I picked up from places, so I may have made some errors.

Basic Guide here (https://github.com/Saner2oo2/mythtv-skyuk/wiki/Basic-usage.)

note. Some channels are missing (some +1's and a few others, but the bulk are there) I will update when have time to do a rescan.

All the info (Channel numbers, XML tag is in the dump, I am sure someone cleverer than me can create an all in one script (hint, hint!)

install szap ( build yourself or apt-get install dvb-apps) you no doubt already have it installed.

edit updateepg

set the script to run at midnight, or a time when you are not recording, as it kills mythbackend

Channels all numbered and set for correct xml info for import (no doubt I have missed some)
