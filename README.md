This is for my own personal use, however others may find handy.

all the info is in the epg dump, i am sure someone clever could write a script to extract channel numbers etc.. to do it automatically (hint hint)

cronjb for midnight (or whenever)

dvbtune sets to EPG background audio.
tv_grab_dvb_plus pulls epginfo
remove crap
importepg.


channels all numbered and set for correct xml info for import( no doubt I have missed some)
