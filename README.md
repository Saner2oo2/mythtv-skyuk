# mythtv-skyuk

This is for my own personal use, however others may find handy.

DISCLAIMER - I am by no means a programmer, or expert, this is all info I picked up from places, so I may have made some errors.

Basic Guide here (https://github.com/Saner2oo2/mythtv-skyuk/wiki/Basic-usage.)

note. Some channels are missing (some +1's and a few others, but the bulk are there) I will update when have time to do a rescan.

All the info (Channel numbers, XML tag is in the dump, I am sure someone cleverer than me can create an all in one script (hint, hint!)

install szap ( build yourself or apt-get install dvb-apps) you no doubt already have it installed.

The updatepg script, may beed editing for thouse of you using ffdecsawrapper or similar (naughty naughty)

set the script to run at midnight, or a time when you are not recording, as it kills mythbackend

Channels all numbered and set for correct xml info for import (no doubt I have missed some)
